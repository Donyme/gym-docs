# Instructions for editing docs

## Editing an environment
If its an Atari environment, directly edit the md file. Otherwise, edit the docstring in the Python file, delete the current markdown file for the gym, and run `_scripts/gen_mds.py`.

## Adding a new environment

### Atari env

For Atari envs, add a md file into `pages/environments/atari` then complete the other steps

### Non-Atari env

- Ensure the Python file corresponding to your environment has a properly formatted markdown docstring and is in gym (or your gym fork). Run `pip install -e .` inside the cloned gym repo. Then, run `_scripts/gen_mds.py`

### Other steps

- Add the corresponding gif into the `videos/` folder of the subfolder. Follow snake_case naming convention. Alternatively, run `_scripts/gen_gifs.py`.
- Edit `_data/pages` and add your new environment. Alternatively, `run _scripts/gen_menus` and replace the content in `_data/pages` within the #AUTOGENERATED comments with what is printed out.
