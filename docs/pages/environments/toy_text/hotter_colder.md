Hotter Colder
The goal of hotter colder is to guess closer to a randomly selected number

After each step the agent receives an observation of:
0 - No guess yet submitted (only after reset)
1 - Guess is lower than the target
2 - Guess is equal to the target
3 - Guess is higher than the target

The rewards is calculated as:
(min(action, self.number) + self.range) / (max(action, self.number) + self.range)

Ideally an agent will be able to recognize the 'scent' of a higher reward and
increase the rate in which is guesses in that direction until the reward reaches
its maximum
