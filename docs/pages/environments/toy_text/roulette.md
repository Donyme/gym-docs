Simple roulette environment

The roulette wheel has 37 spots. If the bet is 0 and a 0 comes up,
you win a reward of 35. If the parity of your bet matches the parity
of the spin, you win 1. Otherwise you receive a reward of -1.

The long run reward for playing 0 should be -1/37 for any state

The last action (38) stops the rollout for a return of 0 (walking away)
