Description:
    The agent (a car) is started at the bottom of a valley. For any given
    state the agent may choose to accelerate to the left, right or cease
    any acceleration.
Observation:
    Type: Box(2)
    Num    Observation               Min            Max
    0      Car Position              -1.2           0.6
    1      Car Velocity              -0.07          0.07
Actions:
    Type: Box(1)
    Num    Action                    Min            Max
    0      the power coef            -1.0           1.0
    Note: actual driving force is calculated by multipling the power coef by power (0.0015)

Reward:
     Reward of 100 is awarded if the agent reached the flag (position = 0.45) on top of the mountain.
     Reward is decrease based on amount of energy consumed each step.

Starting State:
     The position of the car is assigned a uniform random value in
     [-0.6 , -0.4].
     The starting velocity of the car is always assigned to 0.

Episode Termination:
     The car position is more than 0.45
     Episode length is greater than 200
