<p>Easiest continuous control task to learn from pixels, a top-down
racing environment. Discreet control is reasonable in this environment as
well, on/off discretisation is fine.</p>

<p>The game is solved when the agent consistently gets 900+ points.
The generated track is random every episode.</p>

<p>Some indicators are shown at the bottom of the window along with the
state RGB buffer. From left to right: true speed, four ABS sensors,
steering wheel position, gyroscope.
To play yourself (it’s rather fast for humans), type:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>python gym/envs/box2d/car_racing.py
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Remember it’s a powerful rear-wheel drive car - don’t press the accelerator
and turn at the same time.</p>

<h2 id="action-space">Action Space</h2>
<p>There are 3 actions: steering (-1 is full left, +1 is full right), gas,
and breaking.</p>

<h2 id="observation-space">Observation Space</h2>
<p>State consists of 96x96 pixels.</p>

<h2 id="rewards">Rewards</h2>
<p>The reward is -0.1 every frame and +1000/N for every track tile visited,
where N is the total number of tiles visited in the track. For example,
if you have finished in 732 frames, your reward is
1000 - 0.1*732 = 926.8 points.</p>

<h2 id="starting-state">Starting State</h2>
<p>The car starts stopped at the center of the road.</p>

<h2 id="episode-termination">Episode Termination</h2>
<p>The episode finishes when all the tiles are visited. The car also can go
outside of the playfield - that is far off the track, then it will
get -100 and die.</p>

<h2 id="arguments">Arguments</h2>
<p>There are no arguments supported in constructing the environment.</p>
