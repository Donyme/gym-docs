I"·<p>All toy text environments were created by us using native Python libraries such as StringIO.</p>

<p>These environments are designed to be extremely simple, with small discrete state and action spaces, and hence easy to learn. As a result, they are suitable for debugging implementations of reinforcement learning algorithms.</p>

<p>All environments are configurable via arguments specified in each environmentâ€™s documentation.</p>
