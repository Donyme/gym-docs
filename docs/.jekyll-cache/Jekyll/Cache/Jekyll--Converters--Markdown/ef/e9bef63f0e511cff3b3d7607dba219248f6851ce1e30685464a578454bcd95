I"æ<p>This is a simple implementation of the Gridworld Cliff
reinforcement learning task.</p>

<p>Adapted from Example 6.6 (page 106) from Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction
by Sutton and Barto:
http://incompleteideas.net/book/bookdraft2018jan1.pdf</p>

<p>With inspiration from:
https://github.com/dennybritz/reinforcement-learning/blob/master/lib/envs/cliff_walking.py</p>

<p>The board is a 4x12 matrix, with (using NumPy matrix indexing):
    [3, 0] as the start at bottom-left
    [3, 11] as the goal at bottom-right
    [3, 1..10] as the cliff at bottom-center</p>

<p>Each time step incurs -1 reward, and stepping into the cliff incurs -100 reward
and a reset to the start. An episode terminates when the agent reaches the goal.</p>
