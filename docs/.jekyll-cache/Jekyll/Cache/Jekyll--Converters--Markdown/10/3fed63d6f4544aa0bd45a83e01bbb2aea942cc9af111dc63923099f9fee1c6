I"{)<h3 id="description">Description</h3>

<p>This environment is based on the work done by Erez, Tassa, and Todorov in
[“Infinite Horizon Model Predictive Control for Nonlinear Periodic Tasks”]
(http://www.roboticsproceedings.org/rss07/p10.pdf). The environment aims to
increase the number of independent state and control variables as compared to
the classic control environments. The hopper is a two-dimensional
one-legged figure that consist of four main body parts - the torso at the
top, the thigh in the middle, the leg in the bottom, and a single foot on
which the entire body rests. The goal is to make hops that move in the
forward (right) direction by applying torques on the three hinges
connecting the four body parts.</p>

<h3 id="action-space">Action Space</h3>
<p>The agent take a 3-element vector for actions.
The action space is a continuous <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(action, action, action)</code> all in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[-1, 1]</code>
, where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">action</code> represents the numerical torques applied between <em>links</em></p>

<p>The state space consists of positional values of different body parts of the
hopper, followed by the velocities of those individual parts
(their derivatives) with all the positions ordered before all the velocities.</p>

<p>The observation is a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ndarray</code> with shape <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(11,)</code> where the elements

<p><strong>Note:</strong>
In practice (and Gym implementation), the first positional element is
omitted from the state space since the reward function is calculated based
on that value. This value is hidden from the algorithm, which in turn has
to develop an abstract understanding of it from the observed rewards.
Therefore, observation space has shape <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(11,)</code> instead of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(12,)</code> and looks like:
| Num | Observation           | Min                  | Max                | Name (in corresponding XML file) | Joint| Unit |

| 1       | angle of the top                                                 | -Inf                 | Inf                | rooty | hinge | angle (rad) |

<h3 id="rewards">Rewards</h3>
<p>The reward consists of three parts:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>alive bonus</em>: Every timestep that the hopper is alive, it gets a reward of 1,</li>
  <li><em>reward_forward</em>: A reward of hopping forward which is measured
as <em>(x-coordinate before action - x-coordinate after action)/dt</em>. <em>dt</em> is
the time between actions and is dependeent on the frame_skip parameter
(default is 4), where the <em>dt</em> for one frame is 0.002 - making the
default <em>dt = 4</em>0.002 = 0.008*. This reward would be positive if the hopper
hops forward (right) desired.</li>
  <li><em>reward_control</em>: A negative reward for penalising the hopper if it takes
actions that are too large. It is measured as <em>-coefficient <strong>x</strong>
sum(action<sup>2</sup>)</em> where <em>coefficient</em> is a parameter set for the
control and has a default value of 0.001</li>
</ul>

<p>The total reward returned is <strong><em>reward</em></strong> <em>=</em> <em>alive bonus + reward_forward + reward_control</em></p>

<h3 id="starting-state">Starting State</h3>
<p>All observations start in state
(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0) with a uniform nois
e in the range of [-0.005, 0.005] added to the values for stochasticity.</p>

<h3 id="episode-termination">Episode Termination</h3>
<p>The episode terminates when any of the following happens:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The episode duration reaches a 1000 timesteps</li>
  <li>Any of the state space values is no longer finite</li>
  <li>The absolute value of any of the state variable indexed (angle and beyond) is greater than 100</li>
  <li>The height of the hopper becomes greater than 0.7 metres (hopper has hopped too high).</li>
  <li>The absolute value of the angle (index 2) is less than 0.2 radians (hopper has fallen down).</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="arguments">Arguments</h3>

<p>No additional arguments are currently supported (in v2 and lower), but
modifications can be made to the XML file in the assets folder
(or by changing the path to a modified XML file in another folder).</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>env = gym.make('Hopper-v2')
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>v3 and beyond take gym.make kwargs such as xml_file, ctrl_cost_weight, reset_noise_scale etc.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>env = gym.make('Hopper-v3', ctrl_cost_weight=0.1, ....)
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="version-history">Version History</h3>

<ul>
  <li>v3: support for gym.make kwargs such as xml_file, ctrl_cost_weight, reset_noise_scale etc. rgb rendering comes from tracking camera (so agent does not run away from screen)</li>
  <li>v2: All continuous control environments now use mujoco_py &gt;= 1.50</li>
  <li>v1: max_time_steps raised to 1000 for robot based tasks. Added reward_threshold to environments.</li>
  <li>v0: Initial versions release (1.0.0)</li>
</ul>
